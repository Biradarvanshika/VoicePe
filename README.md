## üéØ The Problem

For **500 million+ daily wage workers** in India‚Äîthe plumbers, painters, electricians, and construction laborers who build our nation‚Äîfinding the next job is a daily, uncertain struggle. Mainstream job platforms like LinkedIn or Naukri are inaccessible, requiring smartphones, internet access, and literacy. This digital divide forces workers to rely on unreliable word-of-mouth or exploitative middlemen who often take a 20-30% cut of their meager earnings, perpetuating a cycle of instability and debt.

## üöÄ Our Solution: VoicePe

VoicePe is a mobile job platform built for the real world. We are leveraging the most accessible technology available‚Äî**the human voice**‚Äîto create a fair and empowering job market.

**How it works:**

1. **A worker calls our toll-free number.**
2. Our **AI-powered IVR system** speaks to them in their local language, registering their skill (e.g., "Plumber") and location (e.g., "Hyderabad").
3. **Employers post jobs** via our simple website or even an SMS.
4. The system **instantly matches** the job with nearby, relevant workers and notifies them.
5. The employer and worker connect directly, **with no commission or fees.**

> Vahan is LinkedIn for gig workers. **VoicePe is the ambulance for invisible laborers.**
